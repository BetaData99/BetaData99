I am a data analytics enthusiast pivoting from a film and storytelling background into the world of data-driven insights. While I am proficient in SQL and steadily building my Python skills, I also work regularly with Pandas and Excel to uncover meaningful patterns in data.

Recently, I completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate, and I am currently diving into an exploratory project analyzing the IMDB Top 1000 movies. This project allows me to blend my love of storytelling with analytics, because every dataset has a story to tell, and the fun is unraveling it; beat by beat. I am passionate about bringing those stories to light through creative visuals and thoughtful exploration.

When I am not wrangling data or learning new technical skills, you will find me doing calisthenics, writing, or, true to form, catching up on films. I enjoy exploring the connections between creativity and analytics, and am always curious about the ways data can reveal insights that might otherwise go unnoticed.
